# ‚úàÔ∏è 3D Aircraft Museum

An interactive WebGL-based 3D aircraft museum built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), showcasing high-quality fighter jet models with detailed descriptions, videos, and smooth navigation. Users can explore the virtual museum using keyboard and mouse controls, interact with the models, and learn about each aircraft through embedded YouTube videos and Wikipedia links.
