# VIRTUAL REALITY PROJECTS AND ASSIGNMENTS

Welcome to the **Virtual Reality Projects and Assignments** repository! This repository showcases a collection of academic and exploratory VR assignments developed using **Three.js**. The purpose of these projects is to provide an interactive and immersive learning experience while mastering the fundamentals of virtual reality development and computer graphics.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains assignments and projects for Virtual Reality (VR) development. Each folder contains code, resources, and documentation to help you learn and practice VR concepts using OpenGL and Three.js.

## 📂 Folder Descriptions

* \`\`
  Contains C source code for an OpenGL-based assignment.

* \`\`
  Contains a Three.js web project, including:

  * JavaScript (`app.js`)
  * HTML and CSS files
  * Separate folders for lighting, 3D models, and textures
  * Project-specific README.md

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. **OpenGL Assignment:**

   * Enter the `OPENGL_ASSIGNMENT_PES1PG24CS020` folder.
   * Open `Assignmentclass.c` in your favorite C/C++ IDE.
   * Build and run as a standard OpenGL application.

2. **ThreeJS Project:**

   * Enter the `ThreeJS_Project_PES1PG24CS020` folder.
   * Open `index.html` in a browser that supports WebGL.
   * Modify assets or code in `models/`, `lighting/`, or `textures/` as needed.

---

## 📦 Requirements

* **OpenGL Assignment:**

  * GCC/Clang or MinGW
  * OpenGL libraries (GLUT/GLFW, GLEW, etc.)

* **Three.js Project:**

  * Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
  * Optional: Local server like Live Server extension in VSCode

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D rendering.
* **WebGL**: Rendering interactive 3D graphics.
* **Blender**: 3D modeling and animation.
* **HTML/CSS/JS**: Front-end web technologies.
* **VS Code**: Recommended development environment.

## 🔧 Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally:

### Prerequisites:

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional)
* Use a local HTTP server to serve the project files (e.g., [Live Server extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer))

### Steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/deepakprasad181/VIRTUAL-REALITY-PROJECTS-AND-ASSIGNMENTS.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd VIRTUAL-REALITY-PROJECTS-AND-ASSIGNMENTS

# Open any HTML file inside the assignment folders using Live Server
```

## 📅 Project Highlights

* Smooth scroll-guided room tours.
* Textured 3D furniture and environment.
* Dynamic lighting setup to simulate real-world conditions.
* Integration of Blender models into a browser-compatible VR environment.

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By exploring and understanding these assignments, learners will:

* Grasp the fundamentals of virtual reality.
* Develop 3D web-based applications.
* Gain hands-on experience with modeling and scene design.
* Learn how to simulate interactions and animations within virtual environments.

---

## 📈 Future Scope
